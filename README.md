# Cyberpunk Study - React and Tailwind Learning Project

This is a cyberpunk-themed ambient music player that mixes cyberpunk music with real-time police scanner streams. Built with React, Tailwind CSS, and Howler.js — deployed using GitHub Actions + GitHub Pages.

This project was written as a learning experience as I try to teach myself some front end development. A great deal of this app is vibe coded while I try to learn. All of this is inspired, of course, by the LofiATC project and hopefully we can fill a gap now that it has been taken down.
